# Upskilling for life

***

## Purpose

It is hard to get a software job in 2025. However, rather than letting that be a roadblock, it should be a challenge. Something to overcome. The purpose of this project is to be a source of resources that can serve as a guide for aquiring the skills necessary to overcome the roadblocks and meet the challenges. It will not be easy and it will not always be fun but it can be satisfying and useful and even enjoyable if you see skills building as a life long pursuit.

## What are the skills?
